# Professional Porfolio

## Purpose
This website was made to displaymy skills as a web developer and to showcase my development as a coding student throughout the next few months and beyond. With the hard-work that I'm putting into learning coding I hope that this website will give potential employeers and clients faith in my skills as a web developer. Through this website I will continue to showcase the different skills I'm learning, which can be a great tool to see all the progress I'll be making along the way.
